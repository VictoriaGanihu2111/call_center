 ## Findings

 After a careful analysis, I found that;

 - the most frequently used chanel was via calls, while the least used chanel was via the web
 - the most frequent reason for calling was billing questions
 - the averrage call duration was 25 minutes and this fell within the stipulated SLA

   ## Recomendations

   At the end of my analysis, the following are my recomendations;

   - since most customers prefered using call channels, more call center agents should be employed to further improve the response time that falls within the stipulsted SLA, or simply launch a campaign to promote other chanels
   - an average call duration of 25 minutes is rather on the high side, and call center agents should be further trained on hoe to resolve callers issues in the quickest possible time.
   - with the most frequent reason of calling being billing questions, the management should launch a customer education campaingn o questions concerning billing.
